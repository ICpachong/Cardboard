Cardboard
=========

Project to add mobility features to the Google Cardboard project. Inital plan is to use the onboard accelerometer, then move to other things.If I suceed, please clear the area around you before using, It's very easy to walk into things. ;)

Also, in case it's not clear, I'm not claiming to have written any of this code. This is all (c) Google, I'm just playing in the sandbox under their Apache Liscence (I'm assuming the JAR was included, since it's not avalible anwhere else under a different Liscence. @Google: If this is not the case, please contact me and I'll take this down).
